# All Cleaning Techniques 
- Text Spelling Correction (todo)

# 5 characteristics of quality data
---
- Validity. The degree to which your data conforms to defined business rules or constraints.
- Accuracy. Ensure your data is close to the true values.
- Completeness. The degree to which all required data is known.
- Consistency. Ensure your data is consistent within the same dataset and/or across multiple data sets.
- Uniformity. The degree to which the data is specified using the same unit of measure.


# Issues
- Typos and invalid or missing data- Data cleansing corrects various structural errors in data sets. For example, that includes misspellings and other typographical errors, wrong numerical entries, syntax errors and missing values, such as blank or null fields that should contain data.
- Inconsistent data - Names, addresses and other attributes are often formatted differently from system to system. For example, one data set might include a customer's middle initial, while another doesn't. Data elements such as terms and identifiers may also vary. Data cleansing helps ensure that data is consistent so it can be analyzed accurately.
- Duplicate data - Data cleansing identifies duplicate records in data sets and either removes or merges them through the use of deduplication measures. For example, when data from two systems is combined, duplicate data entries can be reconciled to create single records.
- Irrelevant data - Some data -- outliers or out-of-date entries, for example -- may not be relevant to analytics applications and could skew their results. Data cleansing removes redundant data from data sets, which streamlines data preparation and reduces the required amount of data processing and storage resources.
